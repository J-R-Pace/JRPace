
## Setup Process

For a simple jekyll-based website using the comprehensive minimal mistakes theme, locally developpable and previewable without internet access.

### Install Jekyll

* Ensure you have a suitable version of Ruby installed, for example:
  * ADD STEPS HERE
* Ensure you have jekyll installed 
  * ADD STEPS HERE
* Ensure you have a suitable git-supporting text editing environment, for example:
  * Download+Install Git
    * ADD STEPS HERE
  * Download+Install Visual Studio Code
    * ADD STEPS HERE

### Get & Serve this website

* In XXXXXX, do YYYYYYYYY

## Authoring Workflow

To minimize the github-pages-related and jekyll-related overhead, here's what we've pared the process down to:

* IN YYY, do XXXXXX
* Review the results
* When ready (and connected to the internet), NNNNNNNN
  * Due to the Workspace-level settings in this project, Visual Studio Code should handle pushing and pulling automatically.

For a simple single-author flow, this seems to work fine, with few or no exceptions encountered.

Situations that would require a little more knowledge of Git include:

* Having multiple people working on the site content
* Modifying the site from more than one computer
