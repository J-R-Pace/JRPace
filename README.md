This is the source of a one-off Jekyll-based site, leveraging GitHub pages' jekyll toolchain because it can, but with the simple ambitions of being cheap, portable and maintainable.

The Jekyll theme in use, "minimal mistakes", is included in the site documents itself (rather than being referenced as a remote theme) to make it easier to support local development, while leveraging github's jekyll support. In practice, remote themes turned out to be very bandwidth-heavy and therefore slightly inconvenient.

The author's personal windows setup process and workflow is included for future reference in BUILDING.md.

The license of the theme leveraged is in LICENSE_mmistakes.md.

The actual website code and content viewable here is publically visible by virte of being hosted on GitHub Pages, but is Â© J.R. Pace and not licensed for reuse by third parties in any way at this time.
